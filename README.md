# Investigate-IMDB-dataset
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
The main goal is to investigate Which genres are most popular from year to year? and what kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
Here, I used the jupiter notebook to represent this data analysis process.
